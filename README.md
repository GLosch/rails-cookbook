# Cookbook

> Cookbook was built to solve the problem that arises at the end of a long day, when you can't decide what to make for dinner. Search for recipes based on ingredients you have on hand, and feed yourself like a 21st century human.

- Users can create an account and search for recipes via the Food2Fork api
- After querying the api, users can save recipes to their account

### Future features to be added
- Users will be able to see a page of their saved recipes
- Users will be able to rate their saved recipes
- Users will be able to add comments to their saved recipes (e.g. substitute 1/2 cup of white sugar for brown sugar)
- The search result will include a suggested beer pairing to go along with each recipe
- Users can perform a random search (similar to Google's "I'm feeling Lucky")
